# Portfolio

This repository serves to contain the source-code of my portfolio and to 
host it on GitHub pages. `portfolio` is built to showcase samples of my 
photography and display my past and present projects.

`portfolio` is built using a mixture of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) 
and Javascript (for basic scripting). To build this project, simply clone the
repo, and run the following:

```sh
npm run build:css
```
